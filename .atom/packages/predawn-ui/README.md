# Predawn

### A dark interface and syntax theme for [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/predawn-ui) and [Sublime Text](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Predawn).

## About

Predawn is a minimal interface theme and a syntax color scheme. It was originally just a slightly tweaked version (called Flatland-Alt) of the [Flatland](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/flatland) theme, which itself is a flat reworking of [Soda](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/). I decided to keep going with cusomization and rework the entire theme. But I owe a lot to Flatland and Soda. Thanks guys!

Also, big thanks to @johman10 and @adammw for helping get this ported over!

## Installation

Either, search for it in the Packages section in you Atom settings tab. Or from the command-line run:

## Syntax Theme
I also highly reccomend installing the accompanying syntax theme, called [**predawn-syntax**](https://github.com/jamiewilson/predawn-syntax).

## I also threw in some dock icons just for fun:
